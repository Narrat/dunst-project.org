Downloads  Source tarball Code repository (Github)  Release Notes After about 3 years of inactivity, dunst is back under active development.
Version 1.2 is supposed to be fully backwards compatible with 1.1 but due to the number of changes and the time since the last release there may be some overlooked breakages. If one is found it should be reported to the bug tracker.</description>

      <description>Common problems Cannot open display Dunst was unable to connect to the X server. Make sure that X is running and that the DISPLAY environment variable is correctly set.
If you&amp;rsquo;re using the systemd service, that might mean that dbus isn&amp;rsquo;t setting the right variables, see issue #347 for more details.
Name Lost. Is Another notification daemon running? The connection to the dbus daemon failed or another process is using the notification address.</description>
