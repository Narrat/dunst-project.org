      <description>Common problems Cannot open display Dunst was unable to connect to the X server. Make sure that X is running and that the DISPLAY environment variable is correctly set.
If you&amp;rsquo;re using the systemd service, that might mean that dbus isn&amp;rsquo;t setting the right variables, see issue #347 for more details.
Cannot connect to DBus Dunst cannot connect to your session bus at all. The session bus might not even exist.</description>
